# LoadingBar
### Compatibility
This is designed for C++ use only. I may make versions in python, etc. but don't have a reason to at this point.

### Description
You can use this for anything task that might take time. It runs as a separate thread so it takes minimal work to integrate it into another project.

### TODO
* Allow multiple tasks (multiple loading bars that run simultaneously).
* Add single-header alternative for easy inclusion
